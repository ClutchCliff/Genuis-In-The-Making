# üèóÔ∏è Create a Webpage Using HTML 

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a student, I want to create a biography page that includes an image, a paragraph about me, and my contact information.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the main header reads "Student Bio". 

* It's done when there is a section that includes a name, an image, and a paragraph.

* It's done when there is a second section that includes a subheader labeled "Contact Info" and a list that includes links to my email, GitHub, and portfolio.

* It's done when the finished page matches the mockup. 

## Assets

The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

## üí° Hints

How can you use header elements to define the most important heading and the subheaders? How will using different header elements impact the size of the text? 

To break down the question? First, we ask ourselfs what are "header elements"?; header elements are the size of the header from 
h1-h6"h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6" h1 being the biggest and most important as well as h6 will be the smallest and least important. With these in mind we answer our second answer with h1 being the most informational one as h6 will be least likely info you to be used.

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What are the advantages of using semantic elements in your HTML? 

Back at it again where you ask yourself what are "semantic elements";A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
Examples of non¬≠semantic elements: div and span ¬≠ Tells nothing about its content.
Examples of semantic elements: form, table, and article ¬≠ Clearly defines its
content.
Basically you're going use semantic elements to inform your content will be layouts or formants or table or bubblemaps or an article.
For example the semantic element you'll type in will be < table > without the space inbewteen front and back of the word showing that your going to have a table chart in the following command lines. 

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
