## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What are pseudo-class selectors? A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s). For example, :hover can be used to change a button's color when the user's pointer hovers over it.

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
