# üìñ Create a New GitHub Repository

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to create a new GitHub repository and add an HTML file to it.  

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have created a new repository named `first-day-repo` using the GitHub user interface.

Instead of naming repository as "first-day-repo" I will be naming my repository as "Genuis-In-The-Making".

* It's done when I have cloned the `Genuis-In-The-Making` to my local machine.

Completed 

* It's done when I have used command-line commands to navigate into the `Genuis-In-The-Making` directory.


Using commands such ls, cd, with there modifers like ls -al, cd ., cd .., cd ../ 


* It's done when I have used command-line commands to create an `index.html` file.

Completed; will be renaming "index.html" file to "first-day-demo"

* It's done when I add and commit my changes using Git commands.

Completed; you can check on your local computer thru gitbash as rough draft but do finalize thru gitbush and confirm thru your repo on github as git commands are updated.

* It's done when I push the changes to the remote repository. 

Completed

## üí° Hints

What command can you use to list the contents of a directory? How can you use this command to check your work?

This is redo question from Activity 2: but you'll have type in ls "list out files within that current directory", if you add modifier ls -ah it will show your time of completetion aswhile with additional files/hidden files.
## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What are the `git fetch` and `git merge` commands? 

Best way to know a command code is right after you type in your command code and space"spacebar" --help it will provide you info about that command code. For example: "git fetch --help" the information provide it said "Download objects and refs from another repository" its about similar to clone but your just fetching the update data replacing the out data with present data. Thats where I talk about the next command code "git merge" usually merging two idenitcal files will be automatic and collide into just one directory or folder.

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
