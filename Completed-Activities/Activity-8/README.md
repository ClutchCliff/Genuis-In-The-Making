## üí° Hints

Why is it important that each global attribute is given a unique name? 

I like to ask myself; what is a global attribute? Global attributes are attributes common to all HTML elements; they can be used on all elements, though they may have no effect on some elements. Summary of a global attribute is like an element that will effect the entire page when making one such as autocaptialize add the modifier on should look like these " autocaptialize on " where the entire page every first new sentence will automatically captialize; yes their pretty useful.
